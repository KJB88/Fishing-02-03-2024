    My <a href="https://github.com/KJB88/Games-Development-Portfolio">'Game in a Day'</a> challenge is where I try to make a game in less than 24 hours! Ideally, I work around 8 hours on a game during one day and call it done. But sometimes, I've spread the hours over a period of days, as long as its under 24 hours. I do try to keep to 8 hours or so though, although I have worked on some projects much longer (but still under 24 hours!).
  </p>
  <p>
    To get ideas for the challenge, I just ask people for a single word (or use one I'm interested in doing) and build around that. Kind of like how game jams do it, like <a href="https://threethinggame.com/">Three Thing Game</a> at the <a href="https://www.hull.ac.uk/">University of Hull</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There aren't any other rules really; except have fun! I like to start from scratch and use my own code and libraries without using any 'Quickstart' or 'Game Jam' libraries to speed things up. This helps me build a healthy code library of useful stuff! I enjoy the challenge, creativity and the constraints of the challenge and it produces some funny, interesting or rather scuffed results - but it scratches that itch to create for me.
  </p>
  <p>
    I often try to angle challenge sessions towards working with an unfamiliar technology, like the <a href="https://mirror-networking.com/">Mirror</a> networking library for Unity. I find it helps me learn these libraries and technologies quickly.

<h2>Word: Fishing</h2>
    <p>
      Total Time: 8.5 hours
    </p>
    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <p>
Charge up your cast and launch your bobber out into the lake, then drag in fish in a clash of tactics and stamina. Hit the fishes with your bobber to earn score!

  <li>Hold LMB to charge power.</li>
  <li>Release LMB to cast.</li>
  <li>Mouse position determines the direction of cast.</li>

      <h2>Retrospective</h2>
      <p>
Don't overengineer! I wasted a good two hours trying to whack in coding patterns.
Focus on only what matters, no fluff. I spent waaay too long trying to get a line renderer to replace the quick-n-dirty slider.
Do not refactor for cleaner code until you need to! I eventually had to get an FSM in to replace the Player switch boolean nightmare.
