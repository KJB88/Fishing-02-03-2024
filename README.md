# Fishing_aGaD_02-03-2024
Theme: Fishing 02/03/2024 (a Game a Day Challenge).
Time spent: 8.5hours

CONTROLS:
Hold LMB to charge power.
Release LMB to cast.
Mouse position determines the direction of cast.

Hit the fishes with your bobber to earn score!

CONCEPT:
Charge up your cast and launch your bobber out into the lake, then drag in fish in a clash of tactics and stamina.

IMPL:
Well, I got the first half of that in. In the end I decided to just have the bobber collide with the fish to gain score, as I ran out of time.

LESSONS:
Don't overengineer! I wasted a good two hours trying to whack in coding patterns.
Focus on only what matters, no fluff. I spent waaay too long trying to get a line renderer to replace the quick-n-dirty slider.
Do not refactor for cleaner code until you need to! I eventually had to get an FSM in to replace the Player switch boolean nightmare.
